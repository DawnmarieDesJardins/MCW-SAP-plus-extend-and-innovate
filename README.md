# SAP plus extend and innovate

Contoso Retail, Inc has been selling goods through various retail channels for the past 15 years. Currently, they have just over 200 brick-and-mortar stores but are planning to close 50+ of these stores next year, taking the number of physical locations down to 150 stores due to declining revenue and various other factors.  Of the remaining 150 stores, 35 of them are currently streamlined for an attempted re-branding that happened a few years ago. SAP is the line of business application and database for all customer and supply chain information. 

Contoso needs an ability to collect and analyze data from within SAP in order to make the best uniform solution possible. Contoso wants the ability to take control of their supply chain so that customers can know when and where products are going to be available, and that stores can be prepared to keep up with expected demands.  

This goal of improved ability to meet customer demand will be accomplished by establishing a 360 degree view of the supply chain, with data analysis and reporting that provides the business the ability to plan and schedule deliveries of products according to forecasted needs, based on customer sentiment current buying trends.
