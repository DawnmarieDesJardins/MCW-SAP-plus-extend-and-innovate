# SAP plus extend and innovate student guide

## Abstract and learning objectives

Contoso Retail, Inc has been facing challenges in modernizing its on-premises SAP landscape in order to better compete in the current marketplace. Among the main challenges are:

*   Aging on-premises infrastructure, not capable of running more demanding analytical workloads.
*   Absence of a disaster recovery environment and limited high-availability provisions.
*   Expensive to maintain development and testing environments.
*   Lack of full visibility of supply and demand signals across the value chain.
*   Insufficient customer data, precluding the ability to implement targeted advertising.
*   Suboptimal delivery route planning and scheduling.

As a struggling retailer, Contoso has been dealing with significant financial constraints. Given a hard limit of its capital expenditure budget, Contoso has been considering leveraging its operational budget and taking advantage of the pay-as-you-go model offered by Microsoft Azure. 

To remedy its challenges, Contoso has asked you to design and implement a solution that would help them regain the competitive edge by transitioning their SAP landscape to Azure and modernizing it by leveraging Azure services. 

Key success criteria comprise:

*   A highly available SAP landscape
*   Minimized cost through right-sizing and optimized resource allocation
*   Data integration and analytics capabilities that include:

       *   Collection of purchase data from all channels
       *   Comprehensive view of logistical and operational data, including sensor data from IoT devices in warehouses, stores, and manufacturing plants
       *   Social media sentiment analytics and personalized marketing
       *   Improved delivery route planning and scheduling, leveraging external data feeds that account for such factors as road closures or inclement weather
       *   Optimized demand forecasting with automatic anomaly detection

Your primary objective is to provide integration across all data to be used for analysis and reporting, bringing together manufacturing, supply chain, and sales. Your solution should help the customer (represented by the Chief Marketing Officer, Chief Digital Officer, the Chief Data Officer, and the Customer Experience Manager) to deliver a 360 degree view of the Contoso's business operations and to optimize them through data analytics.

## Step 1: Review the customer case study

**Outcome**

## Step 1: Review the customer case study

**Outcome**

Analyze your customer's needs.

Timeframe: 15 minutes

Directions: With all participants in the session, the facilitator/SME presents an overview of the customer case study along with technical tips.

1.  Meet your table participants and trainer.

2.  Read all of the directions for steps 1-3 in the student guide.

3.  As a table team, review the following customer case study.

### Customer situation

Contoso Retail, Inc has been producing and selling goods through various retail channels for the past 15 years. Currently, they have 20 manufacturing plants and just over 200 brick-and-mortar stores across the United States, but are planning to close 50+ of these stores next year, taking the number of physical locations down to 150 stores due to declining revenue and plans to focus on increasing the volume of online sales. Contoso relies on its on-premises SAP landscape to host line of business applications and databases for all manufacturing, supply chain, and customer data.

Contoso currently collects the store and online sales data and analyzes it within SAP, however, it recognizes that the scope of data collection and analysis is not sufficient to meet demands of the modern marketplace. To remediate this shortcoming, Contoso is looking for the ability to combine all sources of data, including:

*   Sensor data from IoT devices in warehouses, stores, and manufacturing plants
*   Social media sentiment analytics
*   External feeds with such information as road closures and inclement weather

Contoso wants to take control of their supply chain to ensure that their customers can easily locate and purchase the products they are interested in and that their stores are prepared to keep up with the actual demand. To accomplish this, Contoso will need to establish a 360 degree view of the supply chain, with data analysis and reporting that provides the business with the ability to address manufacturing and service issues, plan and schedule deliveries of products according to forecasted needs, and gauge these needs based on customer sentiment and up-to-date buying trends.

As part of its business plan, Contoso is looking to implement the following objectives:

*   Provision compute and storage resources which capacity exceeds what's currently supported by the aging on-premises infrastructure hosting the existing SAP landscape.
*   Increase resiliency by including full-fledged high-availability provisions and setting up a disaster recovery site.
*   Minimize cost of development and testing environments.
*   Whenever possible, simplify the operational model by leveraging managed services.
*   Enhance delivery route planning and scheduling by referencing external data feeds that account for such factors as road closures or inclement weather.
*   Integrate the SAP-resident data with disparate data sources, including Twitter feeds and IoT devices.
*   Automate collection, pre-processing, and analytics of streaming data.
*   Consolidate online and in-store data to facilitate targeted advertising tailored towards individual customers.
*   Improve online customer experience by leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies such as natural language understanding.

### Customer needs

*  Minimize the cost by right-sizing the SAP landscape implementation and optimize the use of compute resources.
*  Leverage Azure services to extend and innovate data collection and analysis (including sensor data from IoT devices, web site and app telemetry, as well as social networking feeds reflecting customer behavior, sentiment, and purchasing patterns).
*  Fine-tune inventory and staff management to ensure all channels are working with the optimal resource allocation according to predicted demands.
*  Streamline remediation of manufacturing service issues and enhance available-to-promise retail capabilities.
*  Minimize the operational overhead.

### Customer objections

1.  We currently have all the data we need, why do we need to do anything else?
1.  We've spent a lot of money and time building out the systems we have, why should we start over in Azure rather than upgrade our existing hardware?
1.  How will this solution help us to create a better process for getting our products from the manufacturing to the warehouses and then to the stores any quicker? Our staff is already working overtime and trucks won't be able to physically drive any faster while maintaining safety standards. 
1.  How can we ensure that privacy of our customers is sufficiently protected if we pursue targeted advertising by leveraging Azure services?
